# Cocktail Recipe Web Application

## Introduction

This project is an implementation of a cocktail recipe sharing and commenting web application by using MEAN stack (MongeDB, Expess, Angularjs, and Node.js). In this web application, registered users can post their own recipe, search and comment other recipes. Google Map and Yelp 3rd API were also included to allow searching for spirits in nearby liquor store.
